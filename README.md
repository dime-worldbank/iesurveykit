# README - This template should be updated

This is DIME Analytics template `README.md`. You should update the information in this README to reflect your project.

This is an excellent place to document what are the prerequisites to run this code and which files in this repository you should run your code from. 

Here are examples of great READMEs that you can draw inspiration from.
These READMES as all for public repositories (as we otherwise could not link to them), 
and private repository might not need as much details describing the project to the public.
Instead, it is important that they link to project protocols
and clearly documents how a new project member would start using the content in this repository.
